Declarative app development is a programming paradigm that focuses on describing the desired state or outcome of an application, rather than explicitly specifying the step-by-step instructions on how to achieve it. It's like telling your assistant what you want done, rather than giving them detailed instructions on every single step.

## What is it?

- Instead of writing "how" to do something, you declare "what" you want to achieve.
- Focuses on the final state of the application and user interface.
- Often relies on components and reactive programming.

## Benefits

- Easier to reason about: You don't need to keep track of every low-level detail, making code more readable and maintainable.
- More adaptable: The framework handles how to achieve the desired state based on different contexts and conditions.
- Reduced boilerplate: Less code needed to achieve the same functionality compared to imperative approaches.
- Improved developer experience: Can be faster and more intuitive to develop with.

## Examples

- Mobile frameworks: React Native, Flutter, SwiftUI
- Web frameworks: React, Vue.js
- UI libraries: React.js, Angular
- Business process automation: ues.io App Builder

## Comparison to imperative programming

- Imperative programming tells the computer "how" to do something, step-by-step.
- Declarative programming describes the desired outcome and lets the framework figure out the "how".
