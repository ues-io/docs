# Declarative App Development

Declarative app development is a programming paradigm that focuses on describing the desired state or outcome of an application, rather than explicitly specifying the step-by-step instructions on how to achieve it. It's like telling your assistant what you want done, rather than giving them detailed instructions on every single step.

## Here's a breakdown of the key points:

### What it is:

-   Instead of writing "how" to do something, you declare "what" you want to achieve.
-   Focuses on the final state of the application and user interface.
-   Often relies on components and reactive programming.

### Benefits:

-   Easier to reason about: You don't need to keep track of every low-level detail, making code more readable and maintainable.
-   More adaptable: The framework handles how to achieve the desired state based on different contexts and conditions.
-   Reduced boilerplate: Less code needed to achieve the same functionality compared to imperative approaches.
-   Improved developer experience: Can be faster and more intuitive to develop with.

### Examples:

-   Mobile frameworks: React Native, Flutter, SwiftUI
-   Web frameworks: React, Vue.js
-   UI libraries: React.js, Angular
-   Business process automation: ues.io App Builder

### Comparison to imperative programming:

-   Imperative programming tells the computer "how" to do something, step-by-step.
-   Declarative programming describes the desired outcome and lets the framework figure out the "how".
