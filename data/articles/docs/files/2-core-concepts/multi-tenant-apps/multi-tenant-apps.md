Multi-tenant apps are software applications where a single instance of the program serves multiple different groups of users, called tenants. Each tenant has their own data and customizations, but they all share the same underlying infrastructure and core functionality.

Think of it like an apartment building: the building itself (the application) is the same for all tenants (users), but each individual apartment (tenant's data and customizations) is unique and separate from the others.

## How they work:

- A single codebase and infrastructure host multiple tenants.
- Data isolation ensures each tenant's data remains secure and invisible to others.
- User access controls determine what each tenant can see and do within the app.

## Benefits

- Cost-effective: Sharing infrastructure reduces development and maintenance costs for both the provider and users.
- Scalability: Easily adding new tenants without requiring additional infrastructure.
- Centralized updates: New features and bug fixes apply to all tenants automatically.
