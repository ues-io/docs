When you want something to do something you have to give a signal. Depending on what you want done depends on the type of signal you would give. A green signal to go and a red to stop.
We refer to actions and instructions as Signals and we use them in a variety of categories.

1. Signals vs. Bots

3. Component Signals

## 1. Signals vs. Bots

Signals are executed in the front-end and rely on an interaction or a state to be fired off. They can only work if the browser is active. Bots on the other hand are run back-end on the server side and they work as long as the server is running. If a user was to fire off a signal in the browser and turn off the power then the signal may fail. If a listener bot was executed and triggers a back-end workflow then the signal will most likely not fail. Signals are really good for adding to the user experience.
