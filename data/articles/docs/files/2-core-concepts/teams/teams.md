The concept behind Teams is for you to be able to create access for others to your app development environment, the Studio, and that can then work with you as you are building. You could even have different workspaces where different teams can work and later merge their work into a single source. Like your front-end team, back-end team, UX, UI and security teams teams could work in different workspaces and not hinder each other.

Once a user has signed up with ues.io that person gets to keep their username for life and have their own access to their own ues.io, pretty much the same way GitHub works. That person can be added to another organization’s teams if they need to work at an enterprise that is building apps and components in their own ues.io instance.
