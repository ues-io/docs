## Download the CLI

Uesio's CLI is distributed as a platform-specific binary executable.

The latest Uesio CLI release binaries, and release notes, can be found at [the uesio Github repo releases area](https://github.com/ues-io/uesio-releases/releases).

Click here to download the ues.io CLI for your operating system and architecture:

- [Linux](https://github.com/ues-io/uesio-releases/releases/latest/download/uesio-linux)
- [macOS (AMD)](https://github.com/ues-io/uesio-releases/releases/latest/download/uesio-macos-amd64)
- [macOS (ARM)](https://github.com/ues-io/uesio-releases/releases/latest/download/uesio-macos-arm64)
- [Windows](https://github.com/ues-io/uesio-releases/releases/latest/download/uesio.exe)

Next, make the binary executable, and move it into your PATH, so that you can use it from any directory:

#### Mac OS

```
chmod +x ~/Downloads/uesio-macos-arm64
sudo mv ~/Downloads/uesio-macos-arm64 /usr/local/bin/uesio
```

(and make sure /usr/local/bin is in your PATH)

**NOTE**: You will be blocked from running the CLI until you trust the app, by going to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy**, and then under "Allow apps from", indicate that you want to allow "uesio" to be run. The next time you try to run `uesio` commands, it should succeed.

### Testing the CLI

You should now be able to run the CLI from any directory. Try running `uesio help` to see a list of available commands:
