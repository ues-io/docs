Components are building blocks for your application and which can be used and for app assembly in the View Builder. Components can be inserted either by double clicking or simply by drag and drop and placed in the View Builder canvas. Most components have attributes that you can set including styling.

Some components can be connected to your data collections via wires and some can execute signals/actions to perform a variety of tasks. You can also set a display condition so that the component appears and disappears according to a condition.

There are many components to choose from and if you donâ€™t find something, or you prefer to make your own components, then you can do so using the ues.io CLI and your favorite code editor.

#### The following come pre-loaded in the View builder and are grouped as follows:

1. Layout
2. Content
3. Data
4. Interaction
5. Visualization
